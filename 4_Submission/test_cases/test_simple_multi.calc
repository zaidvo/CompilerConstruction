# Simple demonstration of Multi-Declaration and Multi-Print

# Multi-Declaration: declare multiple variables in one line
int x = 10, y = 20, z = 30

# Multi-Print: print multiple values separated by commas
print x, y, z

# Multi-Declaration with partial initialization
float a = 1.5, b, c = 3.5
print a, b, c

# Mix and match
string name = "Alice", greeting = "Hello"
print greeting, name

# Print expressions
int num1 = 5, num2 = 10
print num1, num2, num1 + num2
