# Test Program 2: Loops and Conditionals (TYPED SYNTAX)
# This program demonstrates repeat loops with nested if-else statements

print "Finding even and odd numbers from 1 to 10:"

int counter = 1

repeat 10 times:
    # Check if counter is even
    int remainder = counter % 2
    
    if remainder == 0:
        print "Even:"
        print counter
    else:
        print "Odd:"
        print counter
    end
    
    # Increment counter
    counter = counter + 1
end

# Another example with nested conditions
print "Checking numbers 1 to 5:"
