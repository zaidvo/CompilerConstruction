# Test Program 5: While Loop with Break and Continue (TYPED SYNTAX)
# This program demonstrates while loops with break and continue statements

print "Counting from 1 to 10 with skip and break:"

int count = 0
int total = 0


while count < 10:
    count = count + 1
    # Skip number 5
    if count == 5:
        print "Skipping 5"
        continue
    end
    
    # Break if count reaches 8
    if count == 8:
        print "Breaking at 8"
        break
    end
    
    # Add to total
    total = total + count
    print count
end

print "Final sum (excluding 5, stopping at 8):"
print total

# Another while loop example
print "Finding first number divisible by 7:"
int num = 1
boolean found = false

while not found:
    if num % 7 == 0:
        print "Found:"
        print num
        found = true
    end
    
    num = num + 1
    
    # Safety check
    if num > 100:
        break
    end
end

# Countdown example
print "Countdown from 5:"
int countdown = 5

while countdown > 0:
    print countdown
    countdown = countdown - 1
end

print "Blast off!"
