# Test Program 1: Basic Arithmetic and Variables
# This program demonstrates variable declaration, arithmetic operations,
# and operator precedence (TYPED SYNTAX)

# Declare variables with types
int length = 10
int width = 2

# Calculate area
int area = length * width
print "Area of rectangle:"
print area

# Calculate perimeter
int perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
print "Perimeter of rectangle:"
print perimeter

# Demonstrate operator precedence
int result = 2 + 3 * 4
print "2 + 3 * 4 ="
print result

# Demonstrate exponentiation
int power = 2 ^ 8
print "2 raised to power 8:"
print power

# More complex expression
int complex = (10 + 5) * 2 - 8 / 4
print "Complex expression result:"
print complex
